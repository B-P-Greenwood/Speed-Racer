# Speed-Racer

## Overview 

A fun little project to practice what I learned about JS game dev utilising HTML canvas. The player will control a racing car through the streets avoiding the traffic and drive on into the sun. 

The game will be 2D with an over the top Mico machines style view. 

## MVP 

The game view will consist of a 4-6 land road which scrolls long with various vehicles consisting of the traffic and the player will have to avoid them to see how far they can go. 

The player will be able to move the car accross all the lanes of the road along with being able to move up and down to weeve around the traffic. 

The game will have a high score feature to encurage players to replay to beat their previous best. 

## MLP 

Improved visuals, for both the game and the overall website. Add arcade console as the background of the site to give impression game is an old arcade game. 

## Stretch goals 

- Multiple levels which are identified by the different vechicles in the traffic and the background to the road 
- different traffic has differnt route styles, ie. speed changes and will overtake other vehicles.
- pot holes added as a danger to some levels 
- road arches to add speed changes, slower going up the mound and faster on the other side
